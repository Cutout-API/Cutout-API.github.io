  "body": "### What Is Cutout?\r\nCutout is an API that uses the latest graphics technologies to display 2D vector based assets without loss of resolution. Normally to display vector based assets developers are forced to use rasterized versions of them that are locked at a specific resolution. This causes assets to look blurry and distorted depending on the hardware its displayed on. To fix this problem the Cutout API uses vector based assets directly instead of rasterized versions of them. The assets are converted into a 2D triangular mesh that can be rendered in a 3D environment with the highest quality no matter the display hardware used.\r\n\r\n### What Is The Current Status Of The Cutout API?\r\nThe API is currently under initial development and as such is not currently being offered publicly at the moment. A prototype does currently exist and is being updated quickly. Examples of what the API is currently capable can be seen [here]({{ site.github.url }}/construction.html).\r\n\r\n### What OS And Graphic Libraries Are Supported?\r\nInitially only Windows 10 and DX12 will be supported. Windows based technologies were chosen for initial development because of the teams familiarity with them and DX12 being the only next generation graphics library publicly available at the time. Eventually we plan to support Vulkan to enable the API to be useful to those developing for Mac and other Unix/Linux environments.\r\n\r\n### Where Can I Find Detailed API Information?\r\n* Design documents for the project can be found [here]()\r\n* An overview of the various libraries that make up the API can be found [here]()\r\n* Documentation for the latest prototype can be found [here]()\r\n* Information pertaining to the technologies we use and support can be found [here]()\r\n* Frequently Asked Questions can be found [here]()\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Andrew Rose (@roseaw) - Responsible for Development of Cutout API\r\n* Clay Wagner (@claywagnerio)\r\n\r\n##### Copyright 2016.
