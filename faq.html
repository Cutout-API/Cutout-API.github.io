  </h3>
  <p>Initially we will be supporting Windows 10. Eventually we will be supporting some Linux/Unix based operating systems, like Ubuntu. We are also open to the idea of Windows 7 support down the road if there is demand for it.</p>

  </h3>
  <p>Initiallly we will be supporting Microsoft DirectX 12 only. Eventually it is planned to support Vulkan as well to enable wider OS support.</p>

  </h3>
  <p>We initially planned on including the ability to export meshes to standard 3D object formats. Due mainly to time constraints we have not been focusing on this feature. It is still something we plan on doing, but it requires far more research than we had anticipated. The main issue we were running into was figuring out how to properly export color/gradient information in a way that other systems could interpret.</p>
